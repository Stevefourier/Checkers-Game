Each player will have 12 pieces.

All pieces must be placed on black grid squares.

In addition, Player 1 will be given the side of the board grid square A-1 is on.

Player 2 will be given the side of the board with grid square H-1 is on.

Player 1's pieces will be designated by the character 'x'.

Player 2's pieces will be designated by the character 'o'.

Initial piece placement will be as depicted below with each Player's pieces on black grid squares on their respective side of the board.

The game will start with a request to the User to enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2.

A check will be done to ensure that both names are not empty.

If an entered name is empty the User will be prompted to reenter the name.

After the names are entered for the Players, the User will be asked to begin game play via a yes/no question.

An invalid response of characters not 'n', 'N', 'y' or 'Y' will be indicated, and the User will be asked to reenter.
